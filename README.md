A Python implementation for predicting air quality levels using machine learning algorithms. This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Random Forest regression model for environmental insights.

## Features

- Load and preprocess air quality data
- Train a Random Forest regressor to predict AQI (Air Quality Index)
- Evaluate model performance using MAE and R-squared metrics
- Visualize feature importance
- Make predictions on new data samples

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-prediction.git
cd air-quality-prediction
